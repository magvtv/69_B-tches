Sure thing — here are some **sarcastic, darkly humorous, romance-tinged jokes** inspired by Harley Quinn and the Joker in their twisted DC universe, drawing on classic banter from the comics and animated series:

### Joker & Harley Quinn–Style Quips

* **“Me! I’m his nemesis, he’s mine. I mean, we’re together.”**
  Classic absurd love triangle energy, as the Joker claims their bond is more than just boy meets girl—it's arch-nemesis meets arch-nemesis. ([thefanonshipping.fandom.com][1])

* **Harley in labor; Joker’s emotional meltdown:**
  Harley winces, “Don’t worry, Puddin’, it’s not your fault.”
  Joker brightens immediately: “Batman will pay for this!”
  Harley beams: “Now that’s the Puddin’ I know and love.”
  Talk about emotional manipulation... with style. ([Bounding Into Comics][2])

* **“You really put the ‘fun’ in funeral.”**
  Harley deadpans this during a macabre Joker-led funeral scene—sweet, dark, and straight to the twisted heart. ([CBR][3])

* In *“Mad Love”* (animated series), Harley pitches one of Joker’s traps:
  **Harley:** “Everything’s just like you said … except I hung the guy upside down so he sees little frowns as little smiles.”
  Joker tears the blueprint and roars: “If you have to *explain* a joke, there is *no* joke!” Then hits her with a swordfish.
  Brutal sarcasm and slapstick romance at its finest. ([IMDb][4])

### Bonus: Fun “Caption-Style” Lines (Inspired by Their Dynamic)

Here are some extra breezy lines in the style of Insta-captions—playful, chaotic, and a little romantic:

* “Crazy in love and mad about each other.”
* “You’re my favorite punchline.”
* “Partners in crime and in riddles of the heart.”
* “Love is a wild ride, especially with Mr. J driving.”
* “Why so serious? Love’s more fun with a hint of insanity.”

### Best One-Liners to Deploy in Your Twisted “Rom-Com”

**1. “You really put the ‘fun’ in funeral.”**
Sweet, morbid, and perfect for setting a morbid yet flirty tone.

**2. “Don’t worry, Puddin’, it’s not your fault.”**
Then Joker: “Batman will pay for this!”
Harley: “Now that’s the Puddin’ I know and love.”
Ideal for a level where sarcasm meets attachment.

**3. “If you have to explain a joke, there is *no* joke!”**
Cue swordfish props optional. Great for mid-game escalation.

**4. “Me! I’m his nemesis, he’s mine—we’re together.”**
Perfect tagline to tease that messy, obsessive chemistry.
