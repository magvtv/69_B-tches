8/18/25, 02:31 - susanboy: what makes you wake up answers what you're ready for
8/18/25, 08:48 - Phoebe Mwangi: Delay makes the reveal sweeter...or maybe the doors stay shut

8/21/25, 19:17 - Phoebe Mwangi: You'll be fine trust me😂😂
8/21/25, 19:18 - Phoebe Mwangi: I do??🤣🤣
8/21/25, 19:19 - Phoebe Mwangi: I've seen trailers of blood of zeus...r they connected somehow?
Plus i feel like trailers i just spoilers.
I like diving in not knowing what awaits at all!!
8/21/25, 19:20 - Phoebe Mwangi: Can't complain..so far so good 😂😂😂
8/21/25, 20:28 - susanboy: there's this time (early this month before) i came to that church close to your residence. oasis i believe.
8/21/25, 20:28 - susanboy: najua huwezi maliza. uko episode 1 season 1 unasip worra 😂😂😂😂
8/21/25, 20:30 - susanboy: so dramatic 😂
if it's on the first half of the month, then unicorns were a thing.
8/21/25, 20:30 - susanboy: unaogopa horrors na ulizaliwa watu wakiprepare halloween 🥲
8/21/25, 20:32 - susanboy: walai hujawahi ambiwa 😂?
then i am on some rose glasses. imagination 101 😂😂😂🚼 
wacha tu nizitoe. 
sasa artist aligatekeep artworks kama nani
8/21/25, 20:34 - susanboy: they aren't connected in whatever way. 
trailers ni spoilers aje 😂, if anything you can't even get the plot from it, just the feel and "design" of the film
8/21/25, 20:34 - susanboy: is this literally on the show ama figurative as well 😏
8/21/25, 21:09 - Phoebe Mwangi: Unaendanga church??? Whaaat
8/21/25, 21:10 - Phoebe Mwangi: You'll be surprised😂😂
8/21/25, 21:10 - Phoebe Mwangi: Imagine😂😂
8/21/25, 21:11 - Phoebe Mwangi: Love the imagination honestly🤣🤣🤣
8/21/25, 21:12 - Phoebe Mwangi: Naah I once literally watched a whole movie from the trailer!! Never again😂😂
8/21/25, 21:12 - Phoebe Mwangi: Can't give away too much🌚
8/21/25, 21:20 - susanboy: yeah. you should see how far God has brought me. hope this doesn't irritate some demons. <This message was edited>
8/21/25, 21:29 - susanboy: it's funny but quite compelling. anyway, it's in the choice of the enthusiast to glance and mesmer at the galleries
8/21/25, 21:30 - susanboy: why do you like me 😂?
8/21/25, 21:37 - Phoebe Mwangi: 😂😂of course not. 
Its hard to find guys who still go to church
8/21/25, 21:38 - Phoebe Mwangi: Some need the right kind of enthusiasti
8/21/25, 21:39 - Phoebe Mwangi: Like, 'like you like you'??
8/21/25, 21:44 - susanboy: yeah. you know the way someone (like me not you and like you not me) can save up so much horny haha
8/21/25, 21:45 - susanboy: sometimes i wonder if whatever you do to a cat is bad. like don't you want it abused? dug from the inside, hands on deck?
no wait, i meant hands on neck. <This message was edited>
8/21/25, 21:47 - susanboy: enthusiasm. maybe the above is quite one 😂😂😂
8/21/25, 21:48 - susanboy: i am sure that wasn't a trailer. i can bet my... never mind. but it wasn't a trailer haha
8/21/25, 21:50 - Phoebe Mwangi: Bet your what....please continue <This message was edited>
8/21/25, 21:52 - Phoebe Mwangi: Hmm..now im not sure what kind of answer fits this🫠
8/21/25, 21:52 - Phoebe Mwangi: Definitely is😂😂
8/21/25, 21:55 - Phoebe Mwangi: I feel like your easy to talk to..so far
8/21/25, 22:09 - susanboy: if it made you weirdly tingle, that's enough. besides, perhaps you'll feel safer sharing more when i look into your eyes. <This message was edited>
8/21/25, 22:11 - susanboy: you meant 'you're'
quite the ending on the above text. seems you have your eyes to a destination i know not <This message was edited>
8/21/25, 22:13 - susanboy: i see now why sending videos isn't your love language. physical touch. 
can't argue with that; just cause the rest can be gotten from nini...
8/21/25, 22:16 - susanboy: so if it's not sza... who? is your artist a low-key find or a mainstream one?
8/21/25, 22:17 - susanboy: this line... reminds me of aladdin again (rubbing lamps made you a fan perhaps 😂)
there's a part aladdin asks jasmine before she climbs the magic carpet: "do you trust me?"
8/21/25, 22:18 - Phoebe Mwangi: Got any idea what you'll see?.
8/21/25, 22:19 - Phoebe Mwangi: Maybe your part of that destination..
8/21/25, 22:20 - Phoebe Mwangi: 😂😂I feel like for me..effort is my love language
8/21/25, 22:20 - Phoebe Mwangi: You know mereba??
8/21/25, 22:22 - Phoebe Mwangi: There's a reason it keeps coming up then😂😂
8/21/25, 22:34 - susanboy: sounds ethiopian. never heard of her though, proves the low-key find point. 
can you listen to all the songs in 'the breeze grew a fire' no skips <This message was edited>
8/21/25, 22:37 - susanboy: i don't trust. <This message was edited>
8/21/25, 22:39 - susanboy: you're... this second part 'your' intentionally doing it haha
what makes you say that 5'2 shawrie?
8/21/25, 22:40 - susanboy: making an effort to physically touch you? point noted. 
imagine making effort into conflict haha
8/21/25, 22:43 - susanboy: i could give you an answer straight up. but would'nt it be more interesting if you showed me instead?
8/21/25, 22:45 - Phoebe Mwangi: Burrofcos😂

8/21/25, 22:46 - susanboy: left that blank 'cause if i told you, you'd try to collect too soon. imagine if it is my soul or heart haha
8/21/25, 22:47 - Phoebe Mwangi: Okay auto correct 😂
And I im enjoying the journey so far..
8/21/25, 22:49 - Phoebe Mwangi: 🤣thats crazy!! 
Effort is broad, but to be specific its obviously physical touch.
8/21/25, 22:50 - Phoebe Mwangi: I might overwhelm you...
8/21/25, 22:51 - Phoebe Mwangi: Okay I respect the pace 🌚
8/21/25, 23:01 - susanboy: if your eyes are bright enough. the brightest lights cast the darkest shadows... can't suppose the evil that lurks behind the eyes.
8/21/25, 23:02 - susanboy: take that back and say sorry, young lady
8/21/25, 23:09 - Phoebe Mwangi: Only one way to find out.
8/21/25, 23:09 - Phoebe Mwangi: VID-20250821-WA0025.mp4 (file attached)
8/21/25, 23:19 - susanboy: it impresses me how you are living up to the legends.
8/21/25, 23:31 - susanboy: they *l* iked the *c* hase. f *e* d on the *v* ery tension created by making one stretch further in the name of 'appr *e* iciating' their effo *r* t.
8/21/25, 23:33 - susanboy: wh *ic* h b *e* gs: do you doub *tt* yourself, *p* *h* oebe mw *a* ngi?
8/21/25, 23:37 - Phoebe Mwangi: Hmm...I think im supposed to decode something here <This message was edited>
8/21/25, 23:47 - Phoebe Mwangi: Like hiding in puzzles I see👀
8/21/25, 23:55 - Phoebe Mwangi: I just know a masterpiece needs to be unveiled slowly🌚
8/22/25, 01:02 - Phoebe Mwangi: Thats far
8/22/25, 01:04 - Phoebe Mwangi: Drysi..enhe yeah??
8/22/25, 06:24 - susanboy: you shall be punished for this heresy. condemnation awaits. haha.
8/22/25, 08:12 - Phoebe Mwangi: Lol I was so sleepy jana😂😂
8/22/25, 08:12 - Phoebe Mwangi: You'd enjoy that too much, wouldn't you?
8/22/25, 10:41 - susanboy: enjoy punishing? naah. bdsm is a way of life haha
8/22/25, 10:42 - susanboy: how did this go by the way 😂?
8/22/25, 11:07 - Phoebe Mwangi: I think im going to have to ask for help. You got me here 😂😂
8/22/25, 11:07 - Phoebe Mwangi: You sound very experienced 🌚
8/22/25, 11:31 - susanboy: i wish i had experience 😭😂😂😂. i am just a another chilled man
8/22/25, 11:49 - susanboy: this is the type of message you get into the shower and it all becomes revealed to you 😂
8/22/25, 12:20 - Phoebe Mwangi: I highly doubt that😂from the way your talking..you know alot😂😂
8/22/25, 12:21 - Phoebe Mwangi: Or maybe its about finding out for oneself
8/22/25, 12:21 - Phoebe Mwangi: I dont know whether to thank you or blame you for the thoughts now🥲😂
8/22/25, 12:52 - susanboy: not gonna lie, i was stinging you. aiming at your core. "clever" was first part of the puzzle here.
that's easened the second part sasa.
8/22/25, 12:55 - susanboy: mereba has poetic delivery, _sandstorm_ ndio imenituma kwa hii chat hadi. 
another thing as i am listening to _souvenir_ is she's the "find the lyric that feels written for me (you in this case)" vibe
i can see you respond to her substance over surface. <This message was edited>
8/22/25, 12:56 - susanboy: i wonder if you project her... like placing expectations on people to reflect such emotional understanding as mereba does
8/22/25, 13:16 - Phoebe Mwangi: I figured it was clever 😂
So clever phoebe? Has to be cryptic..😂😂
8/22/25, 13:22 - Phoebe Mwangi: Sandstorm was actually my favourite for a long time! 
More like appreciation..her music is very deep
8/22/25, 13:23 - Phoebe Mwangi: Interesting take..I just love when someone feels, almost the way she does.
8/22/25, 13:25 - Phoebe Mwangi: Its nice knowing your listening, almost like sharing a piece of me without saying much haha
8/22/25, 14:30 - susanboy: why so you she doubts your cleverness ma'am 😂
why you were clever is simply in that text
8/22/25, 14:36 - susanboy: couldn't agree more: she has a way of introspecting the aftermath of some relationship i think.
tell me it's not a song from the new album that has replaced it 😂
8/22/25, 14:39 - susanboy: STK-20250205-WA0025.webp (file attached)
8/22/25, 15:45 - Phoebe Mwangi: Okay..very clever 😂😂😂
8/22/25, 15:47 - Phoebe Mwangi: Its not replaced yet😂😂I have many favourites from her so they switch by mood
8/22/25, 16:34 - susanboy: nothing too much to poke your sanity 😂.
8/22/25, 16:36 - susanboy: but mwache kutumia spotify. ever since they removed the heart icon for liking songs and replaced with a simple tick... that was the greatest pet peeve of all time
8/22/25, 16:38 - susanboy: this moon face is traumatizing, nitapata you're not even a pillow princess haha <This message was edited>
8/22/25, 16:46 - susanboy: guess that's you meant all along 😏
8/22/25, 17:35 - Phoebe Mwangi: Thats the worst thing they did fr

8/22/25, 23:05 - Phoebe Mwangi: Probably around 1
8/22/25, 23:11 - susanboy: ah nice. it can wait. you're on some task i believe.

8/22/25, 23:23 - Phoebe Mwangi: What time?
8/22/25, 23:25 - susanboy: time will tell. it's nothing major. i will not give you a preface on it. just know it involves you quite much.
8/22/25, 23:26 - Phoebe Mwangi: Should I be worried😂..or is it something I already know?
8/22/25, 23:30 - susanboy: you aee welcome to guess with 10 chances (that's how unique it is) 😂.
8/22/25, 23:31 - susanboy: maybe its something we both know, could worry you at first.
8/22/25, 23:33 - Phoebe Mwangi: Promise to still tell if I fail all of them 😂 <This message was edited>
8/22/25, 23:34 - Phoebe Mwangi: I need my full armor now🤣
8/22/25, 23:36 - susanboy: i promise i will tell what's necessary, once you fail all ten
8/22/25, 23:37 - susanboy: still hooked on dota dragon blood
8/22/25, 23:41 - Phoebe Mwangi: Was that the deal? 😭😂
Fine. 
Guess 1. Is it how I just texted you out of nowhere? 😂
8/22/25, 23:42 - Phoebe Mwangi: No..namalizia arcane
8/22/25, 23:45 - susanboy: great taste. tell me you've started it today... like you're wrapping up sn 1
8/22/25, 23:46 - susanboy: yeah. you wanted me to promise and be fair to your guessing "effort"

8/22/25, 23:50 - Phoebe Mwangi: Wait you would?🌚
8/22/25, 23:51 - susanboy: moving swiftly to guess 2...
8/22/25, 23:54 - Phoebe Mwangi: Does this topic include anyone else?
8/22/25, 23:54 - Phoebe Mwangi: Even as a third party?
8/22/25, 23:55 - susanboy: this will count as your second guess. no.
8/22/25, 23:56 - susanboy: now i see the taste in animations. jinx ain't all that, i root for the alchemy guy who made vandal into a werewolf.
8/22/25, 23:58 - Phoebe Mwangi: STK-20240530-WA0000.webp (file attached)
8/22/25, 23:59 - Phoebe Mwangi: Jinx annoysss me!!! At first I was like 'go girl' then later just really??
8/23/25, 00:00 - Phoebe Mwangi: Does it have anything to do with your aunt pat?
8/23/25, 00:02 - susanboy: die a hero or live long enough... 😂
homosexuality in arcane as a normal trend in netflix pissed me off with kaitlyn and vi haha
8/23/25, 00:03 - susanboy: third guess. nope. 
on this third party worry, it will only involve me and you. none else. the closest third party i might (low probability) raise will be ann.
8/23/25, 00:03 - susanboy: and you know why haha
8/23/25, 00:09 - Phoebe Mwangi: I agree!! Netflix iliboo with all that
8/23/25, 00:10 - Phoebe Mwangi: Im relived😂😂
8/23/25, 00:13 - Phoebe Mwangi: Don't tell me you're secretly planning to kidnap me🌚🤣
8/23/25, 00:14 - susanboy: stockholm's syndrome seems like a fetish
8/23/25, 00:15 - susanboy: not for long. there might be more as to why that is phobia to phoebe. i will star it.
8/23/25, 00:16 - susanboy: i thought you'd be triggered. i respect you're team pipe haha. 
if you have any lesbo friends, tell them to beware. <This message was edited>

Lemme guess 
5. You want to talk about seeing me?
8/23/25, 00:20 - Phoebe Mwangi: 😂😂what dont you know about me?. 
My "lesbo friends" turned out to like pipe too..it was probably just a phase haha
8/23/25, 00:26 - susanboy: seeing you is impossible, that's guaranteed 😂😂😂😂😂🚼
i know you wouldn't make it if i abruptly told you to
8/23/25, 00:28 - susanboy: i know why you're this freaky 😂😂. remember when i said you've saved too much horny for someone. tutajua ni who. <This message was edited>
8/23/25, 00:30 - susanboy: i didn't know you were once lesbo. ama i have gotten it all wrong. 
perhaps y'all worship pipe after all. wengine hubaki wakipiga makasi hadi nashangaa sana 😂😂😂😂
8/23/25, 00:32 - Phoebe Mwangi: Thats not fair I wasnt even home 😂😂
8/23/25, 00:32 - Phoebe Mwangi: Wait, so now im the horny freak??😂😂
8/23/25, 00:34 - Phoebe Mwangi: Nah it was just those high-school times where trying things were fun, nothing serious. Trust me I think about those times and im like "😬"
8/23/25, 00:35 - Phoebe Mwangi: Beware of you?😏
8/23/25, 00:35 - Phoebe Mwangi: You want to talk about something deeper?
8/23/25, 00:40 - susanboy: it cannot be both of us
8/23/25, 00:40 - susanboy: imagine reading from the notifications and mentally mapping which message he's responding to...
8/23/25, 00:45 - Phoebe Mwangi: STK-20250823-WA0001.webp (file attached)

8/23/25, 00:47 - susanboy: that day i told you we meet at meatons?
by the way, there's a story to that. remind me some day.
that depends on where your home is.
8/23/25, 00:49 - susanboy: regret could be consuming. but threesome sasa ndio the most serious of "trying things" bana 😂

8/23/25, 00:57 - susanboy: but i am the joker, harley 😂

8/23/25, 00:58 - susanboy: you can't be in two places at once. reminds me of how i can focus on two things at once.

you're reminding me tomorrow 😂. kwani you questioned it
8/23/25, 01:01 - Phoebe Mwangi: Is it something you want from me?

8/23/25, 14:31 - Phoebe Mwangi: I had 10 guesses before today..ama i got it wrong?😂😂

8/23/25, 23:55 - susanboy: I got House Rihanna! 👁️ Bold, fearless, and unapologetically authentic. What's your Soul ID? https://strictly-soul-id.vercel.app/results/rihanna
8/23/25, 23:56 - susanboy: i got house rihanna twice on both development and now
8/23/25, 23:56 - susanboy: You do what you want, when you want, how you want - and you make no apologies. Your confidence is magnetic and sometimes intimidating to people who don't understand authentic self-possession. You set trends rather than follow them. You believe in living life on your own terms and inspiring others to do the same.
8/23/25, 23:57 - susanboy: i could agree with it 😂
8/23/25, 23:57 - Phoebe Mwangi: VID-20250823-WA0025.mp4 (file attached)
8/23/25, 23:57 - Phoebe Mwangi: That says something

https://dishi-28980.bubbleapps.io/version-test/?stay=yes

A food delivering company..
8/24/25, 00:08 - Phoebe Mwangi: Im down😂😂
8/24/25, 00:11 - susanboy: great landing page 🤩
i like the visuals and responsiveness
never heard of bubble before, let me check them out.
8/24/25, 00:13 - Phoebe Mwangi: Thank you. 
Its a no code platform..basically just building platforms with no code
8/24/25, 00:15 - susanboy: aah it has subscription tiers hadi, i was snooping at your auth implementation 😂
8/24/25, 00:16 - susanboy: don't tell me this is the client who broke your heart the other day
8/24/25, 00:17 - Phoebe Mwangi: Surely 😂😂😂
8/24/25, 00:18 - Phoebe Mwangi: No it wasnt 😂. He's was incomplete because he wanted work within a short time but with such unreasonable cash
8/24/25, 00:19 - Phoebe Mwangi: So hes review ndio iliharibu😂
And he didnt want to hear any explanations and hes designs were whack😂
8/24/25, 00:20 - susanboy: damn, that's effed up. kwani hajui manners 😭
8/24/25, 00:20 - Phoebe Mwangi: IMG-20250824-WA0000.jpg (file attached)
Imagine this is a landing page🥲
8/24/25, 00:22 - susanboy: ayaya, hapa naye alikuwa anakupima 😭. can't even fathom the mobile layout
8/24/25, 00:23 - Phoebe Mwangi: 😂wacha tu😂😂so he wanted a redesign, but i was designing directly on bubble but the backend!!! It was so complicated but he blamed me for it
8/24/25, 00:23 - Phoebe Mwangi: I didnt even get to finish and I had such a clean inspo🥲😂
Shidake lakini
8/24/25, 00:25 - susanboy: wait so you comfortably do frontend with bubble?
na sasa the client, what was his project requirements to match that short deadline? juu redesign is actually an additional fee.
8/24/25, 00:26 - susanboy: you showed him your redesign sio? 
i think it would have been better doing a g meet with them
8/24/25, 00:28 - Phoebe Mwangi: Yeah. 
The project was already fully working but the user flow as you can see is stressing to even look at.
So he wanted a full redesign
8/24/25, 00:29 - Phoebe Mwangi: Yeah, lemme show you. 
The problem wasnt the redesign..it was hes deadline. 
He wanted it with a week but I wasnt even understanding the app itself
8/24/25, 00:31 - susanboy: that's way too insane. is there a way to vet clients?
8/24/25, 00:32 - susanboy: mimi nashuku ningemtusi kwa email 😂
8/24/25, 00:34 - Phoebe Mwangi: 
8/24/25, 00:34 - Phoebe Mwangi: IMG-20250824-WA0001.jpg (file attached)
So a cleaner landing page was this..coming up with the design took mostly a day but implementing on bubble!!😭😭
8/24/25, 00:34 - Phoebe Mwangi: IMG-20250824-WA0002.jpg (file attached)
8/24/25, 00:34 - Phoebe Mwangi: Yeah, but just through reviews
8/24/25, 00:34 - Phoebe Mwangi: Ikkk😂
8/24/25, 00:35 - Phoebe Mwangi: I wasted my time even making him a freaking logo!!🥲😂
8/24/25, 06:44 - susanboy:

8/24/25, 22:43 - susanboy: no i don't. your feelings are assuming i know your thoughts. that's not communication, harley.
8/24/25, 22:44 - susanboy: let me know if texting is difficult to share. because i believe you can. just do it. like nike 😁
8/24/25, 22:54 - Phoebe Mwangi: Okay your right. I shouldn't assume. Let me try put it into words, the truth is..today felt special, and I had to go walk to think straight because I felt something...
8/24/25, 23:01 - susanboy: go on
8/24/25, 23:11 - Phoebe Mwangi: I texted you in the beginning out of curiosity and the more we talked i realised I liked who you were..so yeah

8/25/25, 01:37 - Phoebe Mwangi: Oh I saw that..did you build it?
8/25/25, 01:37 - Phoebe Mwangi: Thank you..I wont make this mistake again😂😂
8/25/25, 01:38 - susanboy: it is an app called strava. one of those fitness apps, helps tracking your random works and sato runs.
8/25/25, 01:40 - susanboy: i know you will. sijui ni insomnia ama ni nini imekusumbua na hiyo auto complete 😂😂😂😂

8/25/25, 14:27 - Phoebe Mwangi: You fancy chocolate?
8/25/25, 14:51 - susanboy: big fan. a huge sweet tooth as they come.
8/25/25, 15:12 - susanboy: it just hit me that this is a rhetorical question from a chocolate babe i've tasted 😏
8/25/25, 15:49 - Phoebe Mwangi: Okay good to know 😌
8/25/25, 15:52 - Phoebe Mwangi: Guess that makes you the connoisseur 🫠
8/25/25, 18:04 - susanboy: gaddem, nice one 😂
8/25/25, 19:43 - Phoebe Mwangi: <Media omitted>
8/25/25, 21:18 - susanboy: on the dishi app,
how did the inspo fuel into making it? 
ulisikia njaa na uber eats/bolt food/glovo walikuwa wana...dishi chakula yako 🥲
8/25/25, 21:34 - Phoebe Mwangi: STK-20250205-WA0024.webp (file attached)
8/25/25, 21:34 - Phoebe Mwangi: No😂😂😂
8/25/25, 21:36 - Phoebe Mwangi: Funny thing..cause of trans nighting cause of work, I felt annoyed I couldn't get food at that time. Plus I was like why isn't there freelancing chefing
8/25/25, 21:36 - Phoebe Mwangi: But the more I built the more it didnt make sense
8/25/25, 21:36 - Phoebe Mwangi: So i was thinking more cooperative
8/25/25, 21:41 - susanboy: so having like a 24/7 kibandaski. fascinating. our student center back in jkuat was 24/7, back when my body clock was even weirder (sleeping at 7pm waking at 1am). so i used to eat smocha and juice at around 3am ama 4am haha
8/25/25, 21:42 - susanboy: don't dismiss it so quickly. the only thing that would made 24/7 kibandaski not to be profitable ni hakuna hogs wengi kama sisi hizo masaa
8/25/25, 21:43 - Phoebe Mwangi: Na unashiba??😂😂😂
8/25/25, 21:44 - Phoebe Mwangi: Im sure tuko wengi. It just needs proper structure. I know the idea isn't bad, its just bringing it to life
8/25/25, 21:49 - susanboy: STK-20250205-WA0023.webp (file attached)
8/25/25, 21:50 - susanboy: si ninashiba for a few hours 😂😂😂
okay, you got me. i am such a big back 🥲
8/25/25, 21:51 - susanboy: indeed. especially transnighting students kama wa architecture, exam season... it could get traction.
8/25/25, 21:53 - Phoebe Mwangi: 😂😂😂its allowed
8/25/25, 21:55 - Phoebe Mwangi: Yeah it could..But it changes as i build
8/25/25, 21:59 - susanboy: that is always the scary part as a designer. being lost in the build, especially kama ni facts ndio zinakupata
8/25/25, 22:00 - susanboy: what i mean is; you see for this one, someone can come and say 'why not just have day shift and night shift cooks instead' <This message was edited>
8/25/25, 22:04 - Phoebe Mwangi: Thats an interesting approach actually
8/25/25, 22:04 - susanboy: what about frozen yogurt like planet yogurt? i feel it's a dying biz yet it still has potential to it
8/25/25, 22:05 - Phoebe Mwangi: Eeeh it sucks cause you had this whole thing in your head😂
8/25/25, 22:05 - Phoebe Mwangi: So a delivery one? Or
8/25/25, 22:06 - susanboy: STK-20241219-WA0027.webp (file attached)
8/25/25, 22:07 - susanboy: delivery can be a feature, i have a hunch itamezwa na akina uber eats and bolt
8/25/25, 22:08 - Phoebe Mwangi: Yeah true
8/25/25, 22:10 - susanboy: where my head is per design as the design queen you are was just simple marketing. but with a twist
using ordinary people with famous names
8/25/25, 22:12 - susanboy: an example can be
beyoncé tried our strawberry-mango. 

'i'd call it dangerously delicious'

then you have an asterix in small words on the billboard saying: high school teacher named beyoncé wanjiru <This message was edited>
8/25/25, 22:15 - Phoebe Mwangi: Now the marketing world is a whole different skill, you seem to understand it..
8/25/25, 22:19 - Phoebe Mwangi: Cause with dishi, it came from home cooking, then I was thinking cooperative then I just put it aside for now because heh😂😂
8/25/25, 22:25 - susanboy: put it aside means archiving it in your google keep?
8/25/25, 22:28 - Phoebe Mwangi: STK-20250825-WA0017.webp (file attached)

8/25/25, 22:55 - Phoebe Mwangi: Fogerit😂😂
8/25/25, 23:04 - susanboy: a little bird tells me chances you are going to actually commit to a drama show or series tonight are low
8/25/25, 23:06 - Phoebe Mwangi: Why's that??
8/25/25, 23:06 - susanboy: let him cook now
8/25/25, 23:13 - susanboy: if one of us had only a year to live, and we had this year together... how would you wanna live it
8/25/25, 23:22 - Phoebe Mwangi: Honestly, simple things that would feel special. Considering this year is already halfway done🥲😂

Squeezing alot of wild adventures (I love adventure), doing things that we'd fear, sunsets, waste days on trying new food spots also & cooking different cuisines 💯
8/25/25, 23:31 - susanboy: 'space' is a word made up by someone who was afraid to get close
8/25/25, 23:36 - susanboy: that's the thing, isn't it? makes me wanna make sure every 'simple thing' feels like a gem with you haha.
i like the take on wasted days cooking and sunsets, sidhani they would feel wasted because they'd be ours.
8/25/25, 23:39 - Phoebe Mwangi: They'd never feel wasted fossure, time would move too fast to notice
8/25/25, 23:42 - Phoebe Mwangi: Those simple things matter..like how you observant you are which makes you present
8/25/25, 23:43 - Phoebe Mwangi: Favourite line from the song
8/25/25, 23:53 - susanboy: hapa nayo wewe jua umefanya nimesmile mbaya 😌

8/26/25, 00:01 - susanboy: i believe what makes me that observant and always intrigued by you is 'cause i ____ you (there is this word with an o in it... leo wacha nikubali nitastutter 🥲)
8/26/25, 00:02 - susanboy: nyo nyo nyiffrent 😂😂😂
8/26/25, 00:04 - Phoebe Mwangi: Little ol' me made you stutter??🫠I would love to hear it!
8/26/25, 00:04 - Phoebe Mwangi: Cmon now😂😂😂
8/26/25, 00:11 - susanboy: it's in what you're watching right now 😂😂😂
besides, i am very okay with waiting for you to say it for me. <This message was edited>
8/26/25, 00:12 - susanboy: wait. one way you'd make me stutter is when i gawk on me haha
8/26/25, 00:14 - Phoebe Mwangi: Okay i like,..better said in person, though..
8/26/25, 00:15 - Phoebe Mwangi: Stutter wouldn't even happen 🙃
8/26/25, 00:22 - susanboy: you'll not have room to even say this 😂
you'll not even know how to get a napkin to wipe some sauce off your face
8/26/25, 00:22 - susanboy: huyu kijana kanatype sana

8/26/25, 22:27 - susanboy: honestly none on me 😂
8/26/25, 22:28 - susanboy: i realized the reason for preference of either is 
1. cope with trauma
2. loving the pain of penetration (hii ni idea yangu tu haha)
8/26/25, 22:29 - Phoebe Mwangi: Of course 😂😂
8/26/25, 22:30 - Phoebe Mwangi: 😂that makes alot of sense..

8/27/25, 00:00 - susanboy: so we want to be truly seen and loved for that she is. for all that he is.
8/27/25, 00:06 - Phoebe Mwangi: Mmh, im impressed..its kinda scary😂😂

8/29/25, 22:01 - susanboy: i have a few. bringing you into my world adds them up.
8/29/25, 22:09 - susanboy: so there's one thing i dive into lately: notion. not really ati "i know i will be judged" but it's very very therapeutic to dive into systems thinking with any idea. like the cooking app you designed... i was leveling it to other spheres (you can search goldbelly).
i can teach you notion effortlessly. if you let me 😂
for the "others" here's a list: <This message was edited>
8/29/25, 22:16 - susanboy: 
8/29/25, 22:21 - Phoebe Mwangi: I know abit of notion, but yeah teach me beyond the basics 😂
8/29/25, 22:23 - Phoebe Mwangi: Now I definitely understand the sweet tooth 😏

8/29/25, 22:36 - Phoebe Mwangi: Nope. None here 🙃😂
8/29/25, 22:37 - susanboy: not really judging. judge is a harsh word. let's use opinionate 😌
8/29/25, 22:39 - susanboy: we'll end up in a "sugar rush" and you'll start making sounds... the only difference with an actual sugar rush is that you might be energy-drained
8/29/25, 22:41 - Phoebe Mwangi: Well, the one that stood out  for me was the deep ice cream kisses. I've never even imagined that...
8/29/25, 22:43 - Phoebe Mwangi: Sounds delicious to me. With all that sugar?..energy drained? You sure😏

9/4/25, 21:40 - susanboy: i think i have seen the trailer of luck. you as a cat lover najua inakunice niaje 🤩😂😂😂
9/4/25, 21:41 - susanboy: looking at this text, should i be worried about the comfort part in 'comfort food' (period haunting)
9/4/25, 21:51 - Phoebe Mwangi: Oh my bad! 😂😂😂😂
9/4/25, 21:51 - Phoebe Mwangi: Yeah I did 😂😂 it wasnt bad actually
9/4/25, 21:52 - Phoebe Mwangi: Mine isn't a bitch😂. Just alot of cravings and fatigue
9/4/25, 22:12 - susanboy: aah, fatigue najua uncompensate leo na usingizi vizuri 😂😂😂
9/4/25, 22:18 - susanboy: my turn.
thika was great, reached around 10am, went with the white car. before leaving the house, i had carried three chapos and beans with guava juice (don't even start commenting 😂😂😂)
9/4/25, 22:18 - susanboy: it seemed gloomy yet the day turned out sunny. small shamba errand, resolved it to my satisfaction and went to juja. we had agreed to meet with my bros (keith, eric, sam) and we had lunch together. decided to unwind from the hackathon discussion with playing video games from around 1500h to 1613h; i said goodbye and got back home 😂
9/4/25, 22:20 - susanboy: i was on my couch blasting "somewhere" a song by rexx life rajj as i plot on notion all the work to be done tonight (hackathon + the tour website), then i saw your time out text. 

as you read this, i am just breaking grounds with the hackathon idea: matatu route optimization 😌 <This message was edited>

9/5/25, 02:20 - Phoebe Mwangi: Until What time were you planning on the rule to end?😂😂
9/5/25, 02:21 - Phoebe Mwangi: Nice. Is that still phase 0?
9/5/25, 02:56 - susanboy: remembering your reaction to guava juice and your moon face in this text, i am seeing something that i cannot prove yet -- even though i know it is what it is haha
9/5/25, 07:28 - Phoebe Mwangi: 😂😂😂

9/5/25, 11:51 - susanboy: nope. i realized that they'll be the ones giving us the challenge or problem to provide a solution to. crazy days ahead yet we pull through as always 😂😂😂
9/5/25, 11:54 - susanboy: good afternoon (in 5 minutes) harley 🙃

9/5/25, 13:18 - susanboy: yeah i figured you blacked out again haha
9/5/25, 13:18 - susanboy: kwanza hiyo text ya 2am nilisema there's no way ni wewe ama uliamkia short call 😂
9/5/25, 13:22 - susanboy: problem is i am a last minute man 😂😂😂🚼
9/5/25, 13:45 - Phoebe Mwangi: The ending theme music scared me 😂😂😂
9/5/25, 13:45 - Phoebe Mwangi: Bora kazi inafanywa ama?😂😂
9/5/25, 15:24 - susanboy: no way 😂, kwani it blasted through the jbl headphones
9/5/25, 15:25 - susanboy: the end justifies the means 💯😂
9/5/25, 16:40 - Phoebe Mwangi: Ziii izo intstruments 😂😂😂
9/5/25, 16:41 - Phoebe Mwangi: Ndio hiyo sasa😂😂
9/5/25, 22:00 - susanboy: the other day when we talked "frequency" and "vibration" for lack of a better term...

would you also describe it as a kind of magnetism; where the way i speak or how i tend to listen to you touches something deeper in you?

tell me where i might have overstepped with my phrasing. <This message was edited>
9/5/25, 22:01 - susanboy: this is how i journal by the way 😂
9/5/25, 22:19 - Phoebe Mwangi: I think thats close. I feel like    how you understand without too much explaining or almost immediately intrigues me. So yeah a closer term would be magnetism
9/5/25, 22:20 - Phoebe Mwangi: I like it
9/5/25, 22:35 - susanboy: close indeed, that's heartfelt by the way 🌚
there's something i can't stop circling back to.
9/5/25, 22:38 - susanboy: the way you feel safe around me, you know your anchor. it's not just sweet. it's addictive. 

i realized you move through your world as one who knows her ropes. yet, it hits me harder when you say "i like" on the simple little things that i naturally do and end up pleasing you.
9/5/25, 22:48 - Phoebe Mwangi: Wow. Thats such a deep observation..here I am thinking I could fool you lol. 

Seriously though, its scary I let my guard down around you because ive never been one to risk my feelings
(Hope that doesnt put any pressure)
9/5/25, 22:57 - susanboy: you could fool me and be the margot robbie i never knew 😂😂😂
9/5/25, 23:00 - susanboy: baby girl is quite afraid of being known too much rather than too little... maybe. just maybe.
9/5/25, 23:02 - susanboy: people might misread you for your quietness that's for sure 😂

besides, i feel like you'd make good observation of me as well. without the pressure to do it 🙃
9/5/25, 23:06 - Phoebe Mwangi: ...you needed. Kidding!😂😂
9/5/25, 23:09 - Phoebe Mwangi: Vulnerable would be the term...its almost impossible finding authentic connections, both friendly and romantic these days.
In my opinion rather..
9/5/25, 23:11 - Phoebe Mwangi: I would..probably have my observations 😂 still yet to be sure🌚
9/5/25, 23:19 - susanboy: being the margot robbie i needed low-key makes sense... especially when you think about that 'kidding' part 🌚😂
9/5/25, 23:21 - susanboy: inclined to agree to that 
here you go 💐
an opinion that has come across as a fact.
9/5/25, 23:23 - susanboy: still yet to be sure 😂: they  lingering around like some assumptions 😂😂😂. as i said, no pressure to it PHoebe 🙂 <This message was edited>
9/5/25, 23:30 - Phoebe Mwangi: VID-20250905-WA0035.mp4 (file attached)
9/5/25, 23:34 - Phoebe Mwangi: I see what you did there🌚
I wouldn't say assumptions 😂😂.
I do know fossure you have a sweet soul.
9/5/25, 23:37 - Phoebe Mwangi: Yeah!!🙂
I feel like when you take a step back and look at the bigger picture is when you see it.
9/5/25, 23:37 - Phoebe Mwangi: Can I ask you..if you dont mind
9/5/25, 23:37 - susanboy: go ahead
9/5/25, 23:38 - susanboy: no you didn't 🤐
9/5/25, 23:39 - susanboy: STK-20250905-WA0036.webp (file attached)
9/5/25, 23:40 - Phoebe Mwangi: You dont?😂
9/5/25, 23:46 - Phoebe Mwangi: From one of my observations, you connect with people so naturally, I guess you may even bring it out of people too. Im curious do you think its harder to find that kind of connection romantically than in friendships?
9/5/25, 23:51 - susanboy: where's the evidence kwa kaltasi haha
there are two: the name blending and a hidden one 😂
9/5/25, 23:58 - susanboy: there's this word. charisma. need to recheck its definition. 

on the grounds of romance, i would say yes to having misled many chicks, by just being me, in the name of appearing flirty. small talk kidogo mtu ananifuata kila mahali
9/6/25, 00:01 - Phoebe Mwangi: Not sweet like sugar dummy😂😂..but if you say so.
9/6/25, 00:03 - Phoebe Mwangi: I get that..that 'charisma' effect. Its very telling😂
9/6/25, 00:11 - Phoebe Mwangi: I was just curious though, nothing too much to it
9/6/25, 00:14 - susanboy: dummy tena
9/6/25, 00:18 - susanboy: and at the same time, i feel everybody has it walai 😂😂😂

but it's quite interesting now that i digest it: i think people tend to struggle more on the romantic side than with friends
9/6/25, 00:25 - Phoebe Mwangi: All jokes though
9/6/25, 00:27 - Phoebe Mwangi: People 'romantically' go wrong by believing what they want without seeing someone for who they are😂😂
9/6/25, 00:34 - susanboy: their expectations are betrayed to the reality 😂. that's well put. and they feel romantic connections are rarer because stakes are higher
9/6/25, 00:36 - susanboy: i have to bite your bum cheek. sink some teeth just enough you make you feel... pain of penetration.
9/6/25, 00:45 - Phoebe Mwangi: Exactly 😂😂. Its sad but facts. 
Though, it doesn't feel like that here..
9/6/25, 00:46 - Phoebe Mwangi: So is that a debt?🙃
9/6/25, 00:49 - susanboy: i have rabbies 🥲😂😂😂
9/6/25, 00:49 - susanboy: nyai was nyast nyunyiass... 

my pen finds this amusing. how do you even notice that charisma thing? 

juu it makes it harder to filter who actually see me and those who just enjoy the so called charisma force field. i might need your help on spotting... this is not that therapist sort of help 😂 <This message was edited>
9/6/25, 00:52 - Phoebe Mwangi: Really???😂😂
9/6/25, 00:52 - Phoebe Mwangi: We've kissed i guess i have rabies too🌚
9/6/25, 01:00 - Phoebe Mwangi: We already know you pull people in...So in my opinion, to spot this would be when there's that certain shift with you.

 Others might think 'why am I not getting that attention/vibe/energy today' while others would be like,
 'he's awfully quiet or hes masking' 

If its genuine interest, They'd tell in your character in that moment and not your behaviour towards them or how you make them feel. They'd see beyond that 'charm'

In some cases, you'd feel seen too.

9/6/25, 01:06 - susanboy: shurrup. in this together, i like 😂😂😂
