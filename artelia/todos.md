- [] add relevant description to aligns to the artwork shown

### Gallery
- [] need to fix the artwork modal functionality (too large a height)
- [] remove the share artwork part

### Index.html

- [] Create a newsletter for the art drops? Not so sure about this



# TECHNICAL DEBT
- [] improve how the artwork modal renders on smaller screens. allow user to zoomin and zoomout as well.
- [] correct the zooming functionality, image is currently spilling out of the page
