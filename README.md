# 69_B*tches: A Digital Sanctuary for Feminine Expression

*"Where her story matters more than her algorithm"*

## My Vision

This is a curated digital gallery that treats feminine artworks as sacred objects rather than consumable content. Trying to create scarcity, narrative depth, and emotional value around illustrations of women - making them culturally significant rather than just aesthetically pleasing.

## My Mission

To build a **Neo-Renaissance digital sanctuary** where:
- Female-centric art is protected from algorithmic devaluation
- Each artwork carries deep storytelling and emotional resonance
- Reverse image searches are defeated through technical obfuscation
- Community members engage with art as spiritual practice, not social media

## üèõÔ∏è The Core Principles

### 1. **Scarcity Over Virality**
- Limited artwork releases (3-5 pieces weekly)
- Non-searchable, non-shareable formats
- Emotional ownership over monetary transactions

### 2. **Story Over Pixels**
- Every artwork includes poetic descriptions
- Fictional backstories and emotional metadata
- Curator notes that add cultural context

### 3. **Sanctuary Over Gallery**
- Reverent user experience design
- Anti-scraping protection mechanisms
- Community-driven curation and reflection

## My Technical Architecture (Tentatively)

### Frontend Stack
- **Vue.js 3** with Composition API
- **Nuxt.js** for SSR and SEO optimization
- **TailwindCSS** for Renaissance-inspired styling
- **HTML5 Canvas** for image rendering and protection

### Backend Stack
- **Node.js** with Express.js
- **MongoDB** for artwork metadata and user data
- **Cloudinary** for image storage and transformation
- **M-Pesa API** for Kenyan payment integration

### Protection Layer
- Canvas-based image rendering (prevents right-click save)
- Invisible watermarking and noise injection
- Segmented image loading to break scraping attempts
- JWT-based authentication for premium content
